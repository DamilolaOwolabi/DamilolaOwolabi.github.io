### **Objective**
- Automate the process of collecting and analyzing data for cotton fields using a drone-mounted imaging system and machine learning algorithms.
- Provide farmers with insights into **crop yield predictions** and **harvest timelines** via a user-friendly web application.

### **Motivation**
- Traditional methods of crop monitoring are labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming.
- By integrating drones and machine learning, the system aims to reduce costs, improve accuracy, and streamline decision-making in agriculture.

## **Key Features**

1. **Drone Imaging System**
   - Equipped with a Raspberry Pi microcontroller, camera, and GPS module.
   - Captures images of up to 10-acre cotton fields following a programmed flight path.

2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**
   - Analyzes images to predict crop yield and harvest dates with a high degree of accuracy.
   - Utilizes four years of cotton field data for model training.

3. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Web application for farmers to set parameters like GPS coordinates and retrieve analysis reports.
   - Displays interactive graphs and insights generated by the AI model.

4. **Cloud Integration**
   - Data is stored and managed in Google Cloud Storage.
   - Allows users to upload and access data securely.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**
   - Designed with a budget of $400 (excluding the drone).
   - Focused on making precision agriculture accessible to smaller-scale farmers.
