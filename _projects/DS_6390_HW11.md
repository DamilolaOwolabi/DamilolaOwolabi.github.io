## Tools Used

- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library for creative coding, used to generate the interactive visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used to create and export the HTML file that houses the Pokémon visualizations.
- **HTML and JavaScript**: Utilized for creating the dynamic, interactive visualizations on the webpage.

### Files in the Project

1. **HTML Visualization using p5.js**:
   - File: [Pokemon Dashboard](assets/img/DS_6390_HW11/index.html)
   - This HTML file contains interactive visualizations created with **p5.js**, generated via **Jupyter Notebook**.

2. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - File: [Notebook for HTML Generation](https://github.com/DamilolaOwolabi/DS_6390_HW11/blob/main/Owolabi_HW_11.ipynb)
   - This notebook was used to generate the HTML file, incorporating p5.js visualizations into the final webpage.

3. **Dataset Source**:
   - The Pokémon dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon).
   
## Visualization Overview

- **p5.js Dashboard**: The dashboard created using p5.js presents various Pokémon attributes, such as their types and stats, in a dynamic and interactive manner. The visualizations are rendered within a browser for real-time interaction.

### Design Principles

This project employs design principles to ensure that the visualizations are clear, engaging, and user-friendly. Some of the principles include:

- **Interactivity**: Users can interact with various elements, such as clicking on Pokémon types to view specific data points and trends.
- **Visual Clarity**: The visualizations are structured with simple, contrasting colors and clean layouts, making the data easy to understand.
- **Responsiveness**: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience across devices.

## **Visualization Preview**

## How to View

1. **View the HTML Visualization**:
   - Download the [pokemon_dashboard8.html](assets/img/DS_6390_HW11/index.html) file.
   - Open the file in a modern web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox) to interact with the dynamic Pokémon visualizations.

2. **View the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Download the [Owolabi_HW_11.ipynb](https://github.com/DamilolaOwolabi/DS_6390_HW11/blob/main/Owolabi_HW_11.ipynb) file.
   - Open the file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to see how the HTML file was generated.

## Customization

You can easily modify the visualization to:
- Add new data points or features for the Pokémon.
- Customize the color schemes or layouts to match different design preferences.
- Adjust the speed and interactivity of the animations.
