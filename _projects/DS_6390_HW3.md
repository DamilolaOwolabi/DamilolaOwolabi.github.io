## **Project Overview**

This project explores the Pokémon dataset using a combination of data analysis and design techniques. The dataset contains various Pokémon attributes such as type, attack, defense, and more. The analysis includes data cleaning, creating pivot tables, and using charts for visualization, while ensuring that design principles like simplicity, balance, and color theory are applied for clear and impactful visualizations.

### **Dataset Source**
- **Kaggle Pokémon Dataset**: The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle - Pokémon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon).

### **Tools Used**

The following tools and design principles were used in this project:
- **Microsoft Excel**: The primary tool for data analysis, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables**: Used to organize and summarize Pokémon attributes for easy comparison.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visualized relationships between key Pokémon characteristics, such as attack vs. defense, with an emphasis on clear and effective design.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied to highlight important trends in the dataset.
- **Excel Formulas**: Functions such as `VLOOKUP`, `IF`, and `COUNTIF` were employed for calculations and data manipulation.
- **Design Principles**:
  - **Simplicity**: Ensured that each chart focused on a single insight to avoid clutter.
  - **Consistency**: Used consistent colors, fonts, and chart styles throughout the visualizations.
  - **Color Theory**: Applied color schemes that distinguish different Pokémon types without overwhelming the viewer.
  - **Balance and Hierarchy**: Structured the visual elements so that important insights are easily noticed and emphasized.

## **Project Files**

1. **[Excel File: Pokémon Data Analysis](https://github.com/DamilolaOwolabi/DS_6306_HW3/blob/main/Oluwadamilola_Owolabi_HW3.xlsx)** - The Excel file contains the raw data, pivot tables, and visualizations based on design principles to communicate the analysis effectively.

## **Key Highlights**
- **Data Cleaning**: Managed missing values and standardized Pokémon names for consistency across the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used pivot tables and charts to analyze attributes like HP, speed, attack, and defense.
- **Visualization**: Designed charts with clear labels, consistent color schemes, and emphasis on important comparisons (e.g., Pokémon with the highest attack and defense stats).
- **Design Elements**: Applied principles such as simplicity, balance, and effective use of color to ensure that visualizations are both informative and aesthetically pleasing.

## **How to View the Files**
