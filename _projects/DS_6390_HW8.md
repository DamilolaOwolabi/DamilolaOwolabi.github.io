## **Project Overview**

This project visualizes the solar system by simulating the planetary orbits around the sun. Each planet's distance from the sun and its speed of orbit is based on real-world astronomical data (scaled for the purposes of the simulation). The planets, their moons, and the stars in the background are rendered dynamically, with motion updated in real-time.

### **Tools Used**

- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for data visualization, used here to animate the planets and their orbits.
- **HTML and CSS**: For structuring the page and styling the visualization.
- **JavaScript**: Used to dynamically calculate planetary positions, orbit paths, and to animate the celestial objects.

## **Key Features**

- **Sun**: Represented at the center of the system, with an orange color to symbolize the star.
- **Planets**: Each planet orbits the sun with unique speeds and distances, reflecting real-world dynamics in a simplified manner.
  - Planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
  - Each planet is rendered in a distinct color to distinguish between them.
- **Orbits**: The planets move along elliptical paths (represented as orbits), which are drawn dynamically around the sun.
- **Moons**: Moons are visualized orbiting certain planets, like Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
- **Stars**: Background stars are randomly placed to enhance the visual aesthetic of the scene.

## **How to Run the Project Locally**

1. **[Download the Project Files](https://github.com/DamilolaOwolabi/DS_6390_HW8/blob/main/Owolabi_HW8.html)**: Ensure you have the HTML file (`Owolabi_HW8.html`) downloaded to your local machine.
2. **Open in Browser**: Simply double-click the HTML file to open it in a modern browser that supports **D3.js** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. **Enjoy the Simulation**: Watch as the planets and moons orbit the sun in real-time!

## **Details of the Simulation**

- **Planetary Orbits**: Each planet's position is calculated based on simple trigonometric functions, and the planets move continuously around the sun at varying speeds.
- **Sun and Planets**: The sun is placed at the center, and each planet orbits around it in a circular path (elliptical when observed from a side view).
- **Moons**: Moons orbit some planets, adding complexity and realism to the visualization.

### **Customization**

The visualization can be easily customized to add more features or modify the current behavior:
- Change the speed of planetary orbits.
- Add or remove planets or moons.
- Modify the appearance of planets, orbits, or stars.
