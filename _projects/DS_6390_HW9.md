## **Project Overview**

The Dynamic Banner Visualization showcases the power of **D3.js** in creating real-time, interactive web graphics. This visualization includes:

- A set of words displayed in the center of the screen, with each word dynamically changing color on hover.
- Smooth vertical animation of the words.
- Background animation featuring random numbers, circles, bars, and lines that move across the screen continuously.

### **Tools Used**

- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. D3 enables the manipulation of documents based on data.
- **HTML5 and CSS3**: Used for structuring the webpage and styling the visualization.
- **JavaScript**: Provides the logic for animations and dynamic behavior.

### **Key Features**

- **Text Animation**: The words "SMU", "MSDS", "Data", and "Viz" are dynamically displayed in the banner. On hover, their colors change randomly, and they are animated to move vertically within the screen.
- **Background Numbers**: Random numbers are displayed in the background, floating and repositioning continuously across the screen.
- **Background Shapes**: Additional elements like circles, bars, and lines are generated in the background, moving randomly to create an engaging visual effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualization adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that it remains centered and proportionally scaled.

## **How to View the Visualization**

To view the dynamic banner in your browser:

1. **Download the HTML file**: [Download d3_group2.html](https://github.com/DamilolaOwolabi/DS_6390_HW9/blob/main/index.html)
2. **Open the HTML file**: Open the downloaded file in any modern web browser such as Chrome or Firefox.
3. **Interact with the Visualization**: Hover over the text to see color changes, and watch as the background elements continuously animate.

### **Instructions for Running Locally**

1. Download the provided HTML file.
2. Open the file in a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
3. Enjoy the dynamic interaction and animations. There is no need for additional installations, as the project relies on embedded D3.js from a CDN.

### **Code Overview**

The following describes the core components of the code:

- **D3.js Integration**: D3.js is used to generate and manipulate the SVG elements (text, circles, bars, and lines) within the HTML page.
- **Text Animation**: Each word displayed on the screen changes color when hovered over, and the words move vertically in a looped animation.
- **Random Background Elements**: Randomly generated numbers, circles, and bars are displayed and animated across the screen to provide an ever-changing background.

### **Customization Options**

The code can be customized by:
- Adding more words to the banner.
- Adjusting the speed of the animations.
- Modifying the color palette used for the text and background elements.
