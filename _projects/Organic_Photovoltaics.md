### **Objective**
The objective of this study is to:
- Measure the **stress**, **strain**, and **elastic modulus** of the active layer blended with varying percentages of thiolene.
- Optimize the mechanical and electronic properties of OPVs by leveraging thiolene crosslinking.

### **Motivation**
Organic photovoltaics are attractive for their:
- **Flexibility**: Easily integrated into wearable and portable electronics.
- **Low Manufacturing Costs**: Economical production with scalable methods.
- **Versatility**: Potential applications in soft robotics and electronic textiles.

However, their mechanical fragility poses a challenge for practical deployment. This research addresses that by introducing thiolene blends to enhance durability.

## **Research Highlights**

### **Key Components**
1. **Active Layer Materials**:
   - **P3HT**: A donor material for charge separation and light absorption.
   - **PCBM**: An acceptor material for charge transfer.

2. **Thiolene Network**:
   - Crosslinked under UV radiation using **PETMP (Pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate))** and **PAE (Pentaerythritol allyl ether)**.
   - Enhances flexibility by forming a robust thiolene network within the active layer.

## **Methodology**

### **1. Device Fabrication**
1. **Blend**: Mix P3HT and PCBM to form the active layer.
2. **Deposit**: Coat the blended active layer onto the substrate.
3. **Crosslink**: Use UV radiation to form the thiolene network.

### **2. Device Calibration**
- **Syringe Pump Calibration**: Displacement velocity recorded to calibrate volumetric rate.
- **Load Cell Calibration**: Measures force by correlating cell voltage with applied weight.

### **3. Floating Device Testing**
- Floating tests measure the crack onset strain of thiolene crosslinked active layers.
- Films held in place by PDMS and stretched until cracking occurs.
